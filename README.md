# K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier
This project demonstrates a simple implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm using Python and common data science libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn.

# 📁 File Structure
K_Nearest_Neighbor.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook containing:

Data loading and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

KNN model implementation

Model evaluation and visualization

# 📌 Project Description
The KNN algorithm is a supervised machine learning method used for classification and regression. This notebook focuses on classification using KNN. Given a dataset, it:

Splits data into training and test sets

Standardizes the features

Applies the KNN classifier

Evaluates the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

# 🧰 Libraries Used
